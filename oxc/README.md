# qwik-optimizer

Qwik Optimizer remake

**_DISCLAIMER_**: This is very much a work in progress so expect this space to change a lot.

## What

This is a ground up re-implementation of the original Qwik Optimzer.

## Why

The decision was made to mover from SWC to Oxide as the foundation for the Qwik Optimizer.

In the process of doing this, we hope to make the internal Qwik Optimizer more modular and to be more idiomatic Rust.

## Modules

### prelude

This is a collection of common types and traits that are used throughout the Qwik Optimizer.

### component

This module currently contains metadata info for components.

## Usage

Not much save for the unit tests.

## Nix

If you have Nix installed, you can enter a development shell with all the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
nix develop
```

You can also install `direnv` and have it automatically load the development environment when you enter the project directory:

```bash
direnv allow
```
